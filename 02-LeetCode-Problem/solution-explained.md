02 solution explained

function compareTriplets(a, b) {
    <!-- Declares the function compareTriplets that takes two arrays, a and b. -->
    
    let aliceScore = 0;
    let bobScore = 0;
    <!-- Initializes two variables to keep track of Alice's and Bob's total points. -->
    
    for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    <!-- Starts a loop to go through each score in the array. Since each array has 3 elements, the loop runs 3 times. -->

    if (a[i] > b[i]) {
        aliceScore++;
    <!-- Compares Alice's and Bob's scores at the current index i:
    If Alice's score is greater, she gets 1 point (aliceScore++). -->

    } else if (a[i] < b[i]) {
        bobScore++;
    <!-- If Bob's score is greater, he gets 1 point (bobScore++).         -->

    } else if (a[i] == b[i]) {
    }
    <!-- If the scores are equal, nothing happends (no points awarded). -->
}

return [aliceScore, bobScore];
<!-- After the loop finishes, the function returns an array with the total points for Alice and Bob. -->

}

Final solution explanation: The function loops through the arrays, compares corresponding scores, updates Alice's and Bob's points accordingly, and finally returns their total scores as an array.
