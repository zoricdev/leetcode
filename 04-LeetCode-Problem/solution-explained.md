04 solution explained

function diagonalDifference(arr) {
    <!-- The function diagonalDifference takes a square 2D array arr as input. The goal is to calculate the absolute difference between the sums of the two diagonals of the square matrix. -->

    let primarySum = 0;
    let secondarySum = 0;
    <!-- primarySum will store the sum of the primary diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).
    secondarySum will store the sum of the secondary diagonal (top-right to bottom-left). -->
    
    let n = arr.length;
    <!-- n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix). -->
    
    for (let i=0; i < n; i++) {
        primarySum += arr[i][i];     
        secondarySum += arr[i][n-1-i]; 
    }
    <!-- The loop iterates over each row i from 0 to n-1
    Primary Diagonal: arr[i][i] - row index equals column index.
    Secondary Diagonal - arr[i][n - 1 -i] - column index is recersed for each row (n-1-i). -->
    
    let difference = Math.abs(primarySum - secondarySum);
    <!-- Subtract the secondary diagonal sum from the primary diagonal sum.
    Math.abs() ensures the result is always non-negative. -->
    
    return difference;
    <!-- Returns the absolute difference between the two diagonal sums. -->
}

Final solution explanation: The function calculates the sums of the primary and secondary diagonals of a square matrix and returns the absolute difference between them. It efficiently uses a single loop, iterating through the matrix once.
