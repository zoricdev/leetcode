function plusMinus(arr) {
    <!-- Defines a function named plusMinus that takes a single parameter arr, which is expected to be an array of integers. -->

    let positiveCount = 0;
    let negativeCount = 0;
    let zeroCount = 0;
    <!-- Initializes three variables to keep track of how many positive, negative, and zero elements are in the array.
    All counts start at 0. -->
    
    let n = arr.length;
    <!-- Stores the length of the array in the variable n.
    This is used later to calculate ratios and to control the loop iteration. -->
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    <!-- Starts a for loop that iterates through each element of the array from index 0 to n-1. -->

        if (arr[i] > 0) {
            positiveCount++;
        <!-- Check if the current element arr[i] is greater than 0.
        If true, increments the positiveCount by 1. -->

        } else if (arr[i] < 0) {
            negativeCount++;
        <!-- Checks if the current element is less than 0.
        If true, increments the negativeCount by 1. -->

        } else {
            zeroCount++;
        }
        <!-- If the element is neither positive or negative, it must be 0.
        Increments the zeroCount by 1. -->
    }
    
    let positiveRatio = positiveCount / n;
    let negativeRatio = negativeCount / n;
    let zeroRatio = zeroCount / n;
    <!-- Calculates the ratios of positive, negative and zero elements relative to the total number of elements in the array.
    Each ratio is the respective count divided by n. -->
    
    console.log(positiveRatio.toFixed(6))
    console.log(negativeRatio.toFixed(6))
    console.log(zeroRatio.toFixed(6))
    <!-- Prints the ratios to the console.
    toFixed(6) ensures that each ratio is displayed with exactly six decimal places, as required by the problem specification. -->
}

Final solution explanation: The plusMinus function counts how many positive, negative, and zero numbers are in an array, calculates their ratios relative to the total number of elements, and prints each ratio with six decimal places. It uses a simple for loop and conditional checks to categorize the numbers.
