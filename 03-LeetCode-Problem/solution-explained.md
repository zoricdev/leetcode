02 solution explained

function aVeryBigSum(ar) {
    <!-- function name is aVeryBigSum and it takes one parameter, ar, which is an array of long integers. -->

    let sum = 0;
    <!-- Before summing, start with sum = 0, this variable will store the running total of all numbers in the array. -->
    
    for (let i = 0; i < ar.length; i++) {
    sum += ar[i];
    }
    <!-- for loop goes through each index i from 0 to ar.length - 1.
    sum += ar[i] is shortenedfor sum = sum + ar[i].
    During each itration, the current array element ar[i] is added to the running total stored in sum. -->
    
    return(sum);
    <!-- After loop completes, sum contains the total sum of all elements in ar.
    The function returns this sum. -->
}

Final solution explanation: The aVeryBigSum function calculates the total sum of all elements in an array of long integers. It initializes a sum variable to 0, iterates through each element of the array using a for loop, adds each element to sum, and finally returns the accumulated total.
