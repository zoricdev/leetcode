01 solution explained

The function solveMeFirst needs to compute the sum of two integers.

function solveMeFirst(a, b) {
    <!-- a - represents the first input number
    b - represents the second input number -->
    
    var firstValue = a;
    var secondValue = b;

    <!-- a - represents the first input number
    b - represents the second input number -->
    
    return(firstValue + secondValue);

    <!-- firstValue + secondValue adds the two numbers.
    return sends the result back to wherever the function was called. -->
} 

Final solution explanation:
The function solveMeFirst solves the problem by taking two inputs (a and b), assigning them to variables, and returning the sum of those two values.
